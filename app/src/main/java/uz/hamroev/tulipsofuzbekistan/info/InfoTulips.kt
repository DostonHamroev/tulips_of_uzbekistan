        <br><br><b><h5>Map 1, fig. 1.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> This is a rare, sporadically distributed sub-endemic species with decreasing populations and habitats. T. tubergeniana is redlisted at the national level in Tajikistan (2017) and, Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species meets the IUCN Red List criteria of the category of Endangered (EN) (IUCN, 2012). The main threats are overgrazing, degradation and loss of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Surkhan Nature Reserve.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after famous Dutch gardener Cornelis Gerrit van Tubergen (1844–1919).
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> This is one of the highly ornamental species of Tulipa sent to Europe from southern Uzbekistan in the early 19th Century. The history of the journey of this tulip from Uzbekistan to Europe is associated with the name of Austrian (or German) entomologist Joseph Haberhauer (1828–1902). According to available data (Wilford 2006: 161), this tulip was among the species sent for van Tubergen from Bukhara by Haberhauer during his travels to Middle Asia (1861–1862). The species has been described in Gardeners Chronicle (ser. 3; 35: 358, 1904) by John Hoog who noted that «… the species was recommended an Award of Merit at a meeting of the Royal Horticultural Society on May 17, when flowers were exhibited by C.G. van Tubergen, of Haarlem, Holland, to whom we are indebted for the species from which our illustration has been prepared».

The bulb of T. bactriana looks like the bulb of T. kushkensis, but 2 times smaller. Ex-situ, T. kushkensis blooms 3 weeks later than T. bactriana under the same conditions, and the basal leaf of T. kushkensis is situated above the soil surface. In addition, T. bactriana, as T. kushkensis, do not form daughter bulbs under ex-situ conditions, whereas T. tubergeniana commonly propagates by daughter bulbs. Leaves of T. bactriana are less undulate than the leaves of T. tubergeniana.

        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The Latin world "lanatus" means "woolly".
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> The beginning of the history of Tulipa lanata in Europe has been described in detail by Wilford (2006: 124–125): «This species was featured in Curtis`s Botanical Magazine in 1928, where Otto Stapf (1857–1933), who was Austrian botanist, from 1909 to 1922 was the keeper of the Herbarium at the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, wrote that in 1901 C.G. van Tubergen employed a collector, Paul Graeber, to bring back various bulbs and tubers from the Bukhara region in Uzbekistan. According to Stapf, from those and later collections Tulipa lanata came into general cultivation but under different names, including T. tubergeniana, T. hoogiana, T. ingens and T. fosteriana, and he considered them all to be strains of the same species». Tulipa lanata came to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, from Kashmir in 1925. These had originally been collected from the roof of a mosque that collapsed during a flood in 1905. According to Anna Pavord (1999), T. lanata probably has been introduced into Kashmir from Central Asia by the Moguls in the 16th Century and has been planted mostly on the roofs of mosques.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 6, fig. 9–10.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> This tulip species is redlisted at the national level in Tajikistan (1988, 2015), and Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species can be assessed as Endangered (EN) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012). Main threats are mass picking of flowers and bulbs by local people for trade (especially in surroundings of the pass Takhta-Karacha), overgrazing, degradation of habitats. Some populations are protected in the Kitab Nature Reserve.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species was named after Prof. Michael Foster, who gardened at Shelford, near Cambridge (Wilford, 2006).
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> It is one of the most beautiful tulip species introduced in Europe from Uzbekistan. Austrian (or German) entomologist Joseph Haberhauer collected bulbs of this species from the Emirate of Bukhara (the exact location is unknown) during the Middle Asian expedition of 1861–1862 and sent these bulbs to the famous European gardener C.G. van Tubergen. May 26 1906, after several decades of cultivation in Europe, W. Irwing described this species in Garden`s Chronicle. However, the scientific name Tulipa fosteriana W. Irwing has been used for the first time one year before, in 1905, when this plant won an Award of Merit from the Royal Horticulture Society. W. Irwing predicted a great prospect of this tulip in ornamental gardening and noted in Garden`s Chronicle that «the flowers are of very large size, and of a rich, intense, glowing, crimson color, with a darker blotch at the base of the segments; ... of robust habit, and as easily grown as many of the other brilliant species from this part of Eastern Turkestan, T. fosteriana will probably become a favorite plant when more common».

        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> T. affinis is redlisted at the national level in Kyrgyzstan (2006) and Tajikistan (2015), and Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species can be assessed as Vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012). Main threats are overgrazing, degradation and loss of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Nuratau and Zaamin Nature Reserves, and in Zaamin National Park.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> In protologue, Z.P. Botschantzeva emphasized the affinity of this species with Tulipa fosteriana.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> The species has been described on plants grown from bulbs collected by Z.P. Botschantzeva on Turkestan Range near the village Churbek [Kyrgyzstan]. In Uzbekistan, the main habitats of this tulip are located in the central part of the Nuratau Range (Beshko et al., 2013; Tojibaev, Beshko, 2014). Its taxonomical status is a subject of discussion because the morphological differences between Tulipa affinis and T. fosteriana are very unclear. As noted Botschantzeva (1961, 1982), T. affinis “…distinguishes with a more graceful habit, narrower leaves, and smaller flowers”, and its flower “...differs from all other known species by its unusual shape”. Zonneveld (2009: 232) revealed that T. affinis has a substantially higher amount of nuclear DNA than T. fosteriana, but Christenhusz et al. (2013) treated T. affinis as a synonym of T. fosteriana on the grounds that morphological features noted by Botschantzeva “fit within the natural variability of T. fosteriana». Our long-term surveys in natural habitats of both species showed that T. affinis has shorter, stocky, and more pubescent stem, narrower, more undulate and more glaucous leaves than T. fosteriana, it differs by its bulb tunics, flower shape, and shape of central blotch. A completely yellow blotch is never observed in T. affinis. Geographical ranges of these two species are separated. According to J.J. de Groot’s communication, T. affinis is shorter and blooms later than T. fosteriana in the same conditions ex-situ. Because of these facts, we consider Tulipa affinis and T. fosteriana as two distinct, but very closely related species. Of course, further molecular genetic, morpho-anatomical and bio-ecological studies are strongly required.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 9, fig. 15–16.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species is redlisted at the national level in Kazakhstan (2014), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) noted that this species must be assessed in Uzbekistan as Data Deficient (DD) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012). Main threats are overgrazing, mining and degradation of habitats.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> This tulip has been named after the Russian botanist Borszczow (1833–1878), a specialist for plant taxonomy, physiology, and anatomy, who collected this plant for the first time in 1857 from the Aralo-Caspian region.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Previously, this species has been reported as endemic of Kazakhstan widespread in western Betpakdala, Aral deserts, northern Kyzylkum, and the lower reaches of Sarysu River (Vvedensky, 1934, 1941; Vvedensky & Kovalevskaja, 1971; Ivashchenko, 2005). It was not included in the checklist of the flora of Uzbekistan. In 2002, it has been collected from Uzbekistan for the first time (from the western part of Hungry Steppe near the borders with Kyzylkum desert and Kazakhstan (Beshko s.n., 2002, TASH). Specimens collected from the neighboring areas of Kazakhstan are kept at TASH (Adylov 1486, 1961; Makartschuk, 1965). Later, several new populations have been found in the Uzbekistan part of Kyzylkum, including relic mountains Muruntau and Kuldjuktau (Abduraimov, 2016; Shomurodov & Abduraimov, 2018). At present, seven locations of this species are known in Uzbekistan (3 – in the western part of Hungry Steppe and the eastern edge of Kyzylkum, 4 – in relic mountains). The populations of the Hungry Steppe and eastern Kyzylkum are comprised of a yellow form, whereas a red form of this tulip occurs in the insular low mountains Muruntau.

         <br><br><b><h5>Map 10, fig. 17–18.</b></h5>
         <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> T. korolkowii is redlisted at the national level in Kazakhstan (2014), Kyrgyzstan (2006) Tajikistan (1988, 2015), and Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). As suggested by Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species meets the IUCN Red List criteria of the category of Near Threatened (NT) (IUCN, 2012). Main threats are overgrazing, mining, degradation of habitats, picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Hissar, Kitab, Nuratau, Surkhan and Zaamin Nature Reserves and in the Zaamin National Park.
         <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Nikolay Korolkow (1843–1933) – general of the Russian army, the author of scientific works on beekeeping and etymology, and naturalist-amateur who studied the flora and fauna of Middle Asia. He was the initiator and leader of the establishement of forest plantations on the slopes of the Zeravshan Range (Amankutan forestry). According to some sources, he invented and applied the terracing method in forestry. In New Margilan (Fergana Valley), thousands of garden roses and paulownia grew in his garden, which struck his British guest, Lord Denmore in 1893. Eduard Regel described this species in 1875 on the material collected by Korolkow and Krause near Farish (Nuratau Range, Uzbekistan).
         <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Two more species related to Tulipa korolkowii have been described from Middle Asia, and their taxonomical status is a subject of discussion. They are T. rosea Vved. which grows in north Tajikistan (in the western part of Fergana Valley), and T. nitida Hoog widespread in Western Pamir-Alay and South-Western Tien Shan (in the same areas as T. korolkowii). In the “Flora of USSR” (1935: 343) and “Flora of Uzbekistan” (1941: 480, 481), Vvedensky gave T. korolkowii, T. nitida and T. rosea as three geographically separated species, and reported the first of them for foothills of South-Western Tien Shan and Northern Pamir-Alay, the second species – for Western and South-Western Pamir-Alay, and the third species – for the western part of Fergana Valley. However, he noted that the morphological differences between T. korolkowii (leaves exceeding the flower, smaller flower, black filaments, greenish ovary) and T. nitida (strongly curled leaves not exceeding the flower, larger flower pendulous in the bud, black or pink filaments, pinkish ovary) are unclear and the separation of these two species is artificial. Later, in “Conspectus Florae Asiae Mediae” (1971: 103), T. nitida has been treated by Vvedensky & Kovalevskaja as a synonym of T. korolkowii. Based on the results of flow cytometry, Zonneveld (2009) regarded T. korolkowii and T. nitida as two distinct species and T. rosea as T. korolkowii f. rosea (Vved.) Zonn. Christenhusz & al. (2013) considered T. nitida and T. rosea as synonyms of T. korolkowii. According to J.J. de Groot’s personal communication, in the same conditions ex-situ, T. nitida and T. korolkowii f. rosea blooms earlier than T. korolkowii. Concerning T. korolkowii and T. nitida, our long-term surveys in natural habitats and observations in ex situ living collection of TASH and Tashkent Botanical Garden showed that such characters as more or less curled leaves, the length of stem, leaves, and tepals are variable depending on habitat and climatic conditions. Dwarf plants with strongly curled approximate leaves exceeding almost sessile flower occur on open dry stony places, while the plants growing on fine soils in relatively humid and shady places usually are more or less tall, with slightly undulate leaves not exceeding the flower. As for color of filaments and ovary, plants with black, purple, and bicolor black-purple filaments as well as greenish and pinkish ovary can be found in the same population. As regards tulip with pink or crimson flowers which has been treated as T. rosea in above mentioned classical works, we were unable to find any materials confirming the presence of this taxon within the present-day boundaries of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> According to J.J. de Groot’s communication, based on long-term observations in his living collection, at least two forms of Tulipa ferganica can be distinguished: 1) early flowering plants of relatively stocky habit that have been collected from the western part of the species range (Naryn, Osh); 2) late flowering and relatively tall plants from the eastern areas (Kugart). Thus, T. ferganica may be a group of very similar species, and further comparative studies are required.

        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The name of this tulip is associated with the town Talas (Kyrgyzstan), from surroundings of which the species has been found for the first time.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> At first sight, T. talassica looks the same as T. intermedia. But in cultivation, growing under the same circumstances they show their real character, which shows that they are not closely related. T. intermedia is clearly a member of the Korolkowii group of tulips. In the wild it grows on acid soils, granite etc. Whereas T. talassica belongs to the Kolpakovskiana group of tulips, but differ from T. kolpakovskiana and close relatives, that it grows on chalk soil, not that it likes chalk, but it found a way to managed it as shown on the powdered stem on the photo that I took on the type place. In cultivation T. talassica has inner tepals of the same size as the outers or slightly smaller, and has no basal spot, the outer tepals have pale reddish outside. T. intermedia has bigger inner tepals as the outers and a clearly visable small basal spot. Both species differ in in their genetical parts also.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 18, fig. 34–35.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species is redlisted at the national level in Kazakhstan (2014), Kyrgyzstan (2006) and Tajikistan (2015), and Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species meets the IUCN Red List criteria of the category of Vulnerable (VU) (IUCN, 2012). The main threats are overgrazing, degradation and loss of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Chatkal and Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserves and the Ugam-Chatkal National Park.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Samuel Greig (1735–1788), Russian Admiral of Scottish origin, who distinguished himself in the Chesme (1770) and Hogland (1788) battles. In 1870, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Peter the Great, Samuel Greig proposed the idea of creating the Admiralty Garden in St. Petersburg. Later he was elected as the president of the Imperial Russian Horticultural Society. The garden was led by Eduard Regel, who described this tulip in honor of Admiral Greig.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> The species was described in 1873 from plants collected by famous Russian scientists Sewerzow (zoologist) and Fedtschenko (botanist) in the Karatau Mountains (present-time southern Kazakhstan). Firstly, Regel considered this tulip as a variation of the Altai tulip (Tulipa altaica var. karatavica, 1868), but later, in 1873, gave them the species rank. This species is the ornamental plant of the highest importance for selection. It is one of the most beautiful wild relatives hundreds of cultivars of garden tulips. In the international classification, varieties of this species are combined into a separate class of "Greig's Tulips".

        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> All known records of this tulip in Uzbekistan are based on the herbarium collections of the XX Century. The taxonomical status of T. mogoltavica is questionable because the morphological differences between T. mogoltavica and T. greigii are not clear, but these taxa are more or less isolated geographically and plants of T. mogoltavica are smaller than T. greigii. Many authors (Hall, 1940; Wilford, 2006; Christenhusz & al. 2013, etc.), considered this tulip as a synonym of Tulipa greigii. However, Zonneveld (2009), based on the study of original materials from locus classicus (i.e. Mogoltau Range), showed the genetic differences between these two species. A survey of populations and further comparative studies of T. mogoltavica and T. greigii are strongly required.

        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Marc Micheli (1844–1902), a Swiss botanist.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> The species was described in 1902 by Thomas Hoog on specimens collected in 1900 by German botanist Paul Sintenis near Ashkhabad (Turkmenistan). Wilford (2013) treated this tulip as Tulipa undulatifolia var. micheliana (Hoog) Wilford. According to J.J. de Groot’s communication, T. micheliana from the Kopet-Dag and Northern Iran have a lower amount of DNA than the plants from South-Western Pamir-Alay. It shows that under the name of T. micheliana may be a group of very similar species, and further comparative studies are required.

        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species is redlisted at the national level in Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species meets the IUCN Red List criteria of the category of Endangered (EN) (IUCN, 2012). The main threats are overgrazing, degradation of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs by local people for trade (especially in surroundings of the road to the pass Kamchik). Some populations are protected in the Chatkal and Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserves.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Aleksei Ivanovich Vvedensky (1898–1972), a famous expert on Middle Asian flora who treated the genus Tulipa for the “Flora of USSR”, “Flora of Uzbekistan”, “Flora of Tajikistan” and “Conspectus Florae Asiae Mediae”.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> In the protologue, Z.P. Botschantzeva (Botschantzeva, 1954) noted that a substitute bulb and some daughter bulbs of this species can penetrate into the soil to a depth of 12 cm; mainly the daughter bulbs remain instead of the mother bulb; their substitute bulbs also can go deeply into the soil next year. A bulb of generative plants has one tunic and four scales.
        <br>The species is represented mainly by red forms. Initially, I. Turakulov in Tajikistan, and then Tojibaev in Uzbekistan (both localities belong to Kurama ridge) discovered a yellow form of the species (fig. 41).

The taxonomical status of T. butkovii is still uncertain. The main distinctive character of T. butkovii is red filaments. Van Raamsdonk & al. (1996) treated this species as synonym of T. albertii Regel. Zonneveld (2009), Christenhusz & al. (2013) and Everett (2013) restored T. butkovii as a separate species of sect. Vinistriatae (Raamsd.) Zonn.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 23, fig. 45–46.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species is redlisted at the national level in Kazakhstan (2014), Kyrgyzstan (2006), Tajikistan (2015), and Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) noted that this species can be assessed as Near Threatened (NT) according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012). The main threats are overgrazing, degradation and loss of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Chatkal and Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserves and the Ugam-Chatkal National Park.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> Regel named this tulip after General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, Russian military leader, who led the conquest and colonization of Central Asia. Since 1867 – Governor-General of Turkestan, commander of the troops of the Turkestan Military District.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> This tulip is the ornamental plant of the highest importance for selection. J. Rukšāns (2008, 2019) regarded plants from Kazakhstan as separated species Tulipa berkariensis distinguishing from T. kaufmanniana by a lower amount of DNA, spherical bulbs producing 1–2 long stolons bearing vegetative bulblets, and a number of leaves (mostly 2). According to J.J. de Groot’s communication, yellow-flowered tulips from the Uzbek part of the Ugam Range also belong to T. berkariensis.

        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species has been included in first, second and third editions of the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (2019), but not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). According to Tojibaev & Beshko (2014), this species meets the IUCN Red List criteria of the category of Endangered (EN) (IUCN, 2012). The main threats are overgrazing, degradation of habitats, mass picking of flowers and bulbs. Some populations are protected in the Chatkal and Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserves and in the Ugam-Chatkal National Park.
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Chimgan Mountains, a mountain massive located in the western spurs of Chatkal Range 80 km from Tashkent, from where this tulip has been discovered. Chimgan is a famous mountain resort and one of the most important botanical regions of Uzbekistan with rich flora and a significant number of rare and endemic species.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Botschantzeva (1962, 1982), Silina (1977), Krassovskaja & Levichev (1986), Raamsdonk & al. (1997), Pratov & al. (2006) and Zonneveld (2009) regarded T. tschimganica as a separate species of section Spiranthera Vved. According to Vvedensky & Kovalevskaja (1971), this species is a hybrid of T. greigii and T. kaufmanniana. Zonneveld (2009) assumed that 
        <br>T. tschimganica may be the result of hybridization between T. dubia and T. kaufmanniana in the wild. According to Phillips & Rix (1981) and Christenhusz & al. (2013), this taxon takes an intermediate position between T. dubia and T. kaufmanniana and can be considered as a natural hybrid. Before, at previous publications Tojibaev (2010) and Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) regarded it as T. kaufmanniana subsp. tschimganica. According to J.J. de Groot’s communication, T. tschimganica under conditions of cultivation differs with large bulbs, notable bigger than bulbs of T. kaufmanniana and T. dubia.

        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Typically, the populations of T. dubia occur on higher altitudinal zone than Tulipa kaufmanniana and Tulipa tschimganica. However, in the valley Aksay (Greater Chimgan), all three species grow almost on the same elevations but occupy different habitats. The main character, distinguishing T. dubia from other species of sect. Spiranthera Vved. ex Zonn. & Veldk. is the shape of filaments.

        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> The species is redlisted in Kazakhstan (2006), Ukraine (2009) and several regions of Russian Federation, but not evaluated in Uzbekistan because only single record is known. Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) noted that this species must be assessed in Uzbekistan as Data Deficient (DD) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012).
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> Species epithet "biflora" means “two-flowered”.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Tulipa biflora is a very variable species with a wide range, differing greatly in size (Everett, 2013). In the understanding of the volume and geographical distribution of this species, we follow Vvedensky (1935) and Vvedensky & Kovalevskaja (1971) who regarded T. biflora s.s., while Christenhusz & al. (2013) treated T. sogdiana, T. buhseana, T. binutans, and several other species as synonyms of T. biflora. In Middle Asia, this tulip is widespread in the northern part of Middle Asian deserts, and does not occur in Kyzylkum and Karakum. Zonneveld (2009) reported that all accessions of T. biflora s.l. have a rather narrow range of variation in the nuclear DNA values, and differing mainly in the number and size of the flowers. But this author admitted the possibility of the presence of new, undiscovered species from the affinity of T. biflora in Middle Asia. Later, Yu.V. Perezhogin (2013) described two new species from northern Kazakhstan (T. auliekolica Perezhogin and T. turgaica Perezhogin). Everett (2013) reported the yellow form of this species from Afghanistan.

        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Christenhusz & al. (2013) treated T. buhseana as a synonym of T. biflora, but according to our observations and J.J. de Groot’s personal communication, this species is closely related to T. turkestanica. J.J. de Groot also reported that specimens from the Iranian desert growing ex-situ in his collection are tetraploid while the plants from piedmonts of Nuratau are diploid.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 30, fig. 58–59.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> This species has been included in the first, second, and third editions of the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1984, 1998, 2006), but it is not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). As a result of field surveys performed during the last 20 years, it has been revealed that is common in Uzbek part of all mountain ranges of Western Pamir-Alay, and Tulipa turkestanica has been removed from the national Red Data Book. Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) noted that this species can be assessed as Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012).
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> The species is named after Turkestan, a historical name of Middle Asia, a region that includes present-day Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and part of northern Afghanistan (also known as Afghan Turkestan).
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Wilford (2006) stated that Tulipa turkestanica does not grow in Tien Shan, while quite a few localities of this species are known in the Kazakh part of Western Tien Shan, on the ranges Syrdarya Karatau, Talas Alatau, Karakus, and Borolday (Kamelin, 1990; Everett, 2013; www.plantarium.ru). Diana Everett (2013:142) and several participants of the Plantarium Project (www.plantarium.ru) reported a yellow-flowered form of Tulipa turkestanica from Western Tien Shan. There are several specimens collected from the Mogoltau Range (South-western Tien Shan, Tajikistan) in TASH.

        <br><br><b><h5>Map 31, fig. 60–61.</b></h5>
        <br><br><b><h5>Conservation status.</b></h5> This species has been included in first, second and third editions of the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1984, 1998, 2006), but it is not evaluated in the IUCN Red List (2019). As a result of field surveys performed during the last 20 years, it has been revealed that this species Tulipa bifloriformis is widespread in all mountain ranges of Western Tien Shan, often forms large populations, and it is not currently threatened in Uzbekistan. On the basis of this data, this tulip has been excluded from the national Red Data Book. Tojibaev & Beshko (2014) noted that this species can be assessed as Near Threatened (NT) by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012).
        <br><br><b><h5>Etymology.</b></h5> Species epithet "bifloriformis" means “similar to two-flowered”.
        <br><br><b><h5>Note.</b></h5> Depending on the habitat conditions, plants can reach up to 25–30 cm tall. In favourable conditions, this tulip forms dense populations, especially on the slopes of Chimgan Mountains. This species often first occupies eroded slopes after a landslide and form thickets of vegetative individuals.

        Over the past decade, the laboratory of the flora of Uzbekistan and the team of the National Herbarium of Uzbekistan (TASH) led by Academician Komiljon Tojibaev have conducted modern field research, analysis of specimens stored in large herbarium funds (AA, FRU, LE, MW, TAD, and TASH), and created a digital database that reflects the composition and diversity of species of flora of Uzbekistan using GIS software. As a result of this research, the flora of Uzbekistan has been enriched with several species previously unknown to science, and data on the distribution of many plant species have been significantly updated. In this regard, special attention was paid to the taxonomic units, in which the origin and high level of species diversity in Uzbekistan. In particular, the analysis of the diversity, geographical distribution, and status of tulip (Tulipa L.) species in Uzbekistan is part of this research.
